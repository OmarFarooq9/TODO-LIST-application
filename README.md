# TODO-LIST-application
TODO LIST APP TO MAKE A TODO LIST FOR ROUTINE/SCHEDULES.
The advantages are:

The Web3.0 ToDo app can provide a decentralized and secure platform for managing tasks. It is possible for users to have complete control over their data and do not need to rely on centralized servers to store and manage their tasks.

With Solidity smart contracts integrated into the system, tasks and their ownership can be verified on the blockchain, increasing transparency and trust.

As a framework, Next.js provides a seamless, responsive user experience, as well as server-side rendering and search engine optimization.

Its uses include:

Individuals or teams can use Web3.0 ToDo to manage their tasks decentralized and securely.

This app can be useful for developers who want to learn how to build decentralized applications using Next.js and Solidity.

For companies interested in exploring the potential of Web3.0 and blockchain technology, the app can serve as a demo project.

Problems faced:

Building Web3.0 applications can be challenging, as it requires knowledge of both blockchain technology and web development.

There may be issues with the performance of the app due to the added complexity of interacting with the blockchain.

The adoption of Web3.0 and blockchain technology is still in its early stages, and there may be limited user adoption and awareness of the technology.
